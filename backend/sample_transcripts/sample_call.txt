Sales Rep: Hi, thanks for taking the call today. How are you?
Customer: I’m good, thanks. We have about 20 minutes.
Sales Rep: Great. Can you share how you handle sales follow-ups today?
Customer: Mostly spreadsheets and manual reminders. It’s messy.
Sales Rep: What’s the biggest pain point with that setup?
Customer: We miss follow-ups and don’t have visibility into pipeline.
Sales Rep: Understood. What would success look like for you?
Customer: Automated follow-ups and better reporting.
Sales Rep: Makes sense. What’s your timeline for improving this?
Customer: Ideally this quarter, but budget is tight.
Sales Rep: Thanks for sharing. If we can show ROI and a simple setup, would that help?
Customer: Yes, but I’d need buy-in from my manager.
Sales Rep: Perfect. Let’s plan a short demo and include your manager.
Customer: Sounds good.
