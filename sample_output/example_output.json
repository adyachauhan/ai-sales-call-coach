  "transcript": "Sales rep Brad, yeah, hi, is this Michael? Customer Michael, uh yes, who's calling? Brad, Brad from Tech Force Systems. Look, I'll cut to the chase. You're leaving money on the table every single day you're not using our platform. Michael, I'm sorry, what platform? I don't think I. Brad, doesn't matter. What matters is that your competitors are already using us and they're crushing it. I'm looking at your website right now, and honestly, your current setup is probably costing you thousands in lost productivity. When can we get this implemented? Michael, hold on, I don't even know what you're selling, and I'm actually in the middle of. Brad, Michael, Michael, I get it. You're busy. Everyone's busy. That's exactly why you need this. Listen, I've got a special promotion that expires literally today. If you sign up in the next hour, I can get you 30% off, but I need a decision now because after today, my manager's pulling the offer. Michael, I don't make purchasing decisions in an hour. I'd need to see a proposal, talk to my team. Brad, your team, come on, you're the decision maker, right? Look, I've been doing this for 12 years. Trust me on this. Every client who waits ends up regretting it. Just give me your email and I'll send over the contract. We can have you up and running by tomorrow. Michael, I really don't think this is the right time. Brad, that's what everyone says. And then 6 months later they call me back saying, Brad, you were right, we should have done this sooner. Don't be that guy. What's your credit card company, Visa or Mastercard? Michael, I'm going to have to go. Please don't call this number again. Brad, fine, but when your competition leaves you in the dust, don't say I didn't warn you. I'll call back next week when you've had time to think about it.",
