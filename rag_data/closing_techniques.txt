# Closing Techniques – Sales Coaching Knowledge Base

Purpose:
Guide sales representatives in confidently moving a conversation toward a clear next step or decision.

## Closing Techniques

1) Trial Close
Used to gauge readiness.
Example Lines:
- “How does this sound so far?”
- “Does this align with what you’re looking for?”

2) Summary Close
Used to confirm understanding and value.
Example Lines:
- “To recap, you’re looking for A, B, and C — is that correct?”
- “Based on what we discussed, does this feel like a good fit?”

3) Next-Step Close
Used when the goal is progression, not purchase.
Example Lines:
- “Would it make sense to schedule a demo?”
- “Can we set up a follow-up call next week?”

4) Assumptive Close
Used when the customer has shown clear agreement.
Example Lines:
- “Let’s get the next step scheduled.”
- “I’ll send the calendar invite now.”

Best Practices:
- Always confirm the next step.
- Avoid vague endings like “we’ll follow up.”
- Closing should feel helpful, not pushy.
