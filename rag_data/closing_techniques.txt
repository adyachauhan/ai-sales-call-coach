Closing techniques help move a sales conversation toward a decision.

Examples of closing techniques:
- Assumptive close: Proceeding as if the customer has agreed
- Summary close: Recapping key benefits discussed
- Trial close: Asking how the customer feels about next steps
- Urgency close: Highlighting limited-time benefits

Effective closing should feel natural, not forced.
