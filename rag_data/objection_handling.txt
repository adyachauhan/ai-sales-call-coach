Objection handling is the process of addressing customer concerns without being defensive.

Common objections include:
- The price is too high
- We are happy with our current vendor
- We need more time to decide
- This is not a priority right now

Best practices:
- Acknowledge the concern
- Ask clarifying questions
- Respond with value, not pressure
- Confirm understanding before moving forward
