Tone and empathy are critical in sales conversations.

A positive sales tone should be:
- Calm and confident
- Respectful and professional
- Curious rather than aggressive

Empathy involves:
- Actively listening
- Validating customer feelings
- Avoiding interruption
- Responding thoughtfully to concerns

Customers are more likely to trust salespeople who show genuine empathy.
