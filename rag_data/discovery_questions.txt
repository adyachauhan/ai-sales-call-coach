Discovery questions help sales representatives understand a prospect’s needs, pain points, and goals.

Examples of strong discovery questions:
- Can you walk me through your current process?
- What challenges are you facing with your existing solution?
- What does success look like for you in the next 6–12 months?
- What tools or platforms are you currently using?
- What prompted you to explore a new solution now?

Good discovery focuses on listening more than speaking.
