        "Closing techniques help move a sales conversation toward a decision.\n\nExamples of closing techniques:\n- Assumptive close: Proceeding as if the customer has agreed\n- Summary close: Recapping key benefits discussed\n- Trial close: Asking how the customer feels about next steps\n- Urgency close: Highlighting limited-time benefits\n\nEffective closing should feel natural, not forced.",
        "Discovery questions help sales representatives understand a prospect’s needs, pain points, and goals.\n\nExamples of strong discovery questions:\n- Can you walk me through your current process?\n- What challenges are you facing with your existing solution?\n- What does success look like for you in the next 6–12 months?\n- What tools or platforms are you currently using?\n- What prompted you to explore a new solution now?\n\nGood discovery focuses on listening more than speaking.",
        "Tone and empathy are critical in sales conversations.\n\nA positive sales tone should be:\n- Calm and confident\n- Respectful and professional\n- Curious rather than aggressive\n\nEmpathy involves:\n- Actively listening\n- Validating customer feelings\n- Avoiding interruption\n- Responding thoughtfully to concerns\n\nCustomers are more likely to trust salespeople who show genuine empathy."
