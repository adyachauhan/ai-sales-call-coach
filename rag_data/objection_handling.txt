# Objection Handling – Sales Coaching Knowledge Base

Purpose:
Help sales representatives identify, acknowledge, and address customer concerns without creating pressure.

## Common Sales Objections

1) Budget / Pricing Objection
Occurs when the customer is unsure about cost or value.
Examples:
- “That seems expensive.”
- “I’m not sure we have budget for this.”
- “We need to think about the cost.”

Best Practices:
- Acknowledge the concern calmly.
- Reframe cost in terms of value or ROI.
- Ask clarifying questions about budget range.

Example Responses:
- “I understand — can you share what budget range you had in mind?”
- “If we could show how this saves time or money long-term, would that help?”

2) Timeline Objection
Occurs when the customer delays a decision.
Examples:
- “We’re not ready yet.”
- “Maybe later this year.”
- “Now isn’t the right time.”

Best Practices:
- Ask what’s driving the timing.
- Identify urgency or upcoming deadlines.
- Avoid forcing a decision.

Example Responses:
- “What would need to happen before this becomes a priority?”
- “Is there a specific timeframe you’re working toward?”

3) Trust / Confidence Objection
Occurs when the customer is unsure about credibility or fit.
Examples:
- “We’re happy with our current solution.”
- “I need to think about it.”

Best Practices:
- Share proof points (customers, results).
- Ask what they like or dislike about their current setup.
